        <h1>Darek Charlet</h1>
        <h3>Home</h3>
        <p>
            My favorite location is home because it's <B>quiet</B>, and <b>I dont have to talk to anyone</b>.
            Also, no one has ever asked me akward questions like "what is your favorite location"
            at home. That seems to be limited to classrooms of intro level courses.
