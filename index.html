        <h4>Home</h4>
        <p>
            My favorite location is home because it's <B>quiet</B>, and <b>I dont have to talk to anyone</b>.
            Also, no one has ever asked me akward questions like "What is your favorite location?"
            at home. That seems to be limited to classrooms of intro level courses.

        <h4>Knuth–Morris–Pratt Algorithm</h4>
        <blockquote>
            In computer science, the Knuth–Morris–Pratt string-searching algorithm (or KMP algorithm) 
            searches for occurrences of a "word" W within a main "text string" S by employing the observation 
            that when a mismatch occurs, the word itself embodies sufficient information to determine where 
            the next match could begin, thus bypassing re-examination of previously matched characters.
